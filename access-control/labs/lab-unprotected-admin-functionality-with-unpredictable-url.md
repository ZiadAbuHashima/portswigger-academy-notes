# Lab: Unprotected admin functionality with unpredictable URL

**Official lab:** [https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-unprotected-admin-functionality-with-unpredictable-url](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-unprotected-admin-functionality-with-unpredictable-url)

## Lab idea

An admin panel has an unpredictable address, but the application reveals its location in client-side content. The challenge practices understanding why obscurity does not replace server-side authorization.

## Vulnerability in brief
Access control decides whether an authenticated user may perform a requested action or access a particular resource. It is distinct from authentication, which establishes identity, and session management, which associates requests with that identity. Broken access control occurs when an application lets a user access a resource or perform an action outside their authorization. Insecure direct object reference (IDOR) is a familiar subcategory, not a synonym for every access-control flaw.

## Solution idea
1. Review the lab home page's source using Burp Suite or your web browser's developer tools.
2. Observe that it contains some JavaScript that discloses the URL of the admin panel.
3. Load the admin panel and delete carlos .
